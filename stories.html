        <p class=strytit>the story about this and that</p>
        <p class="story">Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there
            live the blind texts.<br>
            Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small
            river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.<br>

            It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the
            all-powerful
            Pointing
            has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of
            blind
            text by
            the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.<br>

            The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and
            devious
            Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the
            belt
            and made
            herself on the way.<br>

            When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her
            hometown
            Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a
            rethoric
            question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.<br>

            The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times
            and
            everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn
            around
            and return
            to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
            few
            insidious
            Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where
            they
            abused her
            for their projects again and again.

            And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains,
            far
            from the
            countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right
